This update is the ninth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.


=== Notable changes

As with last month, a big part of the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-07+sort%3Acreated-asc[
10 pull requests merged] were bug fixes or minor changes. Though some valuable
work was also finished.

==== Asus Zenfone Max Plus (M1)

The port for link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/175[asus-x018d]
is mainly notable for being the only alternative system to the OEM-provided
Android system, with the exception to a TWRP that is using the OEM-built kernel.

This means that, for the first time, Mobile NixOS this is the only alternative
system for a device, including other Android-based systems.

Finishing with a last note, this device has an older Mediatek SoC, compared to
the other ported Mediatek device. There is not much to say, except that it was
found that older Mediatek devices may exhibit a similar quirk to Qualcomm
devices, where the framebuffer has to be refreshed explicitly for the display
to be updated.


==== External device definitions

I hesitate to openly discuss about this pull request, as it might make
contributors think they should not contribute their devices back. link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/162[#162]
adds a mechanism to maintain and build external device definitions.

These external definitions should only be used for devices that are not welcome
to the main project. The main reason a device would not be welcome is if it is
not a “Mobile device”. An example of such a device is the link:https://github.com/samueldr/mobile-nixos-extra-devices/tree/master/devices/pine64-pinebookpro[Pinebook Pro],
which is a laptop. Another example would be porting to SBCs like a Raspberry Pi.


==== Updates for the boot GUI

This change, link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/189[#189], is
where most if this month's development time was spent. The toolkit used for the
boot GUI has been forked and adapted to serve the goal of providing a GUI for
mobile devices better.

As part of the changes, some minor UX (User eXperience) changes have been made,
but more importantly, major changes like properly supporting mouse and touch
screens in an independent manner, and providing keyboard-driven input. This
also adds support to navigate the GUI with the volume keys and the power
button, which is a common scheme used to provide a fall-back navigation when
touchscreen support is possible.

Except for the new way added to interact with the GUI, there are no major
changes to how the GUI is used. Though the work is a first step to provide more
in-depth options during the boot process, like tracking progress, and required
user input for actions during boot like passphrase input.


=== New ports

One new device was merged this month.
