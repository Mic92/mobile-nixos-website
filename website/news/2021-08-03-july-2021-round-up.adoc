This update is the eighteenth in a series of regular updates on the state of
the project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.


=== Notable changes

During the two months link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-07+sort%3Acreated-asc[
12 pull requests were merged].


==== Stage-1 apps re-design

link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/364[The applications for
stage-1 were redesigned in #364]. Though it is an understatement to imply that
they only were redesigned. While, yes, this follows the design language of the
redesigned website, some work was needed to achieve the result.

First, support for truetype fonts needed to be added to the GUI toolkit. While
it may seem like it's not required for this limited use case, in reality this
not only allows using more fonts than the hardcoded ones, it allows _scalable_
fonts. With these changes, text should be big and readable on all devices.

Truetype fonts support also gives us the ability to fall back to other fonts.
This initial implementation falls back to FontAwesome, giving us access to the
full library of glyphs, rather than a selected subset.

In addition to these user-facing changes, a lot of work was done to rework some
parts of the implementation and packaging of these applications. This should
reduce the burden on packaging new features or applications made with this
toolkit.

In another pull request, large images link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/390[
were fixed]. This fixes corruption with images with higher resolution devices.


==== Notable changes

==== Device-specific changes

A flurry of changes for the Pinephone, most authored by link:https://github.com/tomfitzhenry[@tomfitzhenry].
