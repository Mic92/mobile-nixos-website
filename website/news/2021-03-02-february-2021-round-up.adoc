This update is the fifteenth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.


=== Notable changes

During the month link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-02+sort%3Acreated-asc[
18 pull requests were merged].

Compared to the last month, they're more subtle changes.


==== More hermetic evaluation

This started off the work from link:https://github.com/eamsden[@eamsden], where
uses of `<nixpkgs>` were removed almost everywhere in link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/238[#238].

With the changes, the value `<nixpkgs>` is now used only at one location, at
the start of the evaluation, in a way that can be overridden easily if needed.

This means that evaluation now works fine without a `NIX_PATH`. This is useful
to allow users of Nix flakes to use the project.

Similar changes were made in link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/310[#310]
to rely on a single `<nixpkgs>` value for `release.nix` and example
configuration evaluations.


==== Finalize stage-0

When link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/262[#262] was merged in
December, it was done so with two main features missing.

Time was taken to link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/300[finish
the boot features for stage-0 in #300].

When a device supports _stage-0_ boot, a new toggle is shown in the generations
list allowing the user to skip rebooting into the generation's kernel.

When booting a generation, the _device tree_ built from the same kernel source
tree is now used. The pull request itself contains technical details. This was
less trivial than expected.


==== armv7 works again

Using armv7 with Nixpkgs or NixOS is not always easy. There is no binary cache,
and cross-compilation is as YMMV as it is for AArch64.

This is the reason why armv7 Mobile NixOS devices haven't seen much work done
and things slowly started not working.

With link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/306[#306] time was taken
to ensure contributors with armv7 devices wouldn't be left with hard to debug
issues from Mobile NixOS itself.

With this work finally taken care of, there is a recent known good starting
point to use for armv7 devices.

A few recent WIP device ports were made on top of these changes. Stay tuned as
they may become supported devices at some point in the future.

==== Android Flashable Zips

With link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/320[#320, Android flashable
zip support] was added to Mobile NixOS. This is used to produce `.zip` files
that can be installed to the devices using the mechanism commonly used to apply
OTA updates in Android.

Why would this new flashing method be needed or desired?

First, it is more universal than `fastboot`, as some OEMs implement alternative
flashing modes in their devices (e.g. Odin for Samsung).

Then, some devices (e.g. `oneplus-oneplus3`) have problematic fastboot flash
behaviours when flashing to the `userdata` partition. Some devices (e.g.
`amazon-austin`) need to apply some out-of-band "fixes" to the boot images,
which happens for free when using a flashable zip.

With that said, all methods to flash the system to the device should produce
the same outcome in most cases. As long as your device boots fine, there is no
reason to prefer one or the other flashing method.


==== Device-specific changes

===== Wi-Fi support for Pixel XL

Following last month's updates, link:https://github.com/danielfullmer[
@danielfullmer] made the required changes to
link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/295[enable Wi-Fi for
`google-marlin` (#295)].


=== Ports

No new port were made in February. There is still a 
link:https://mobile.nixos.org/devices/index.html[total of 17 devices] you can
build for.
