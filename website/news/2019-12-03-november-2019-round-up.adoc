This update is the first of a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.

=== Notable changes

Among the changes, and the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-11[10 PRs merged],
these changes are highlighted.


==== initrd: add fbterm modules

When the new `mobile.boot.stage-1.fbterm` options are enabled, a userspace
implementation of a console is started, attached to the output of tty1.
As of right now, this is a read-only view of the console.

This is still extremely useful on targets where the kernel-based virtual
consoles will not work. As long as the framebuffer is setup, you can use the
console to observe what is going on.

==== Documentation and website framework

This was briefly highlighted in the last news item, though let's describe how
the documentation and website generation ticks. 

The generated documentation in the repository is always built
using the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/tree/master/doc[same exact tooling]
as the website. In fact, the website is only adding files to the documentation
directory to build itself.

This gives us the advantage of the documentation being trivial to build locally.

```
~/.../mobile-nixos $ nix-build ./doc/
these derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-mobile-nixos-docs.drv
[...]
/nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-mobile-nixos-docs

~/.../mobile-nixos $ ls -l result/index.html 
-r--r--r-- 4 root root 1541 Dec 31  1969 result/index.html

~/.../mobile-nixos/mobile-nixos-website $ xdg-open result/index.html 
[...]
```

The documentation, minus the news items, will open in your web browser, and work
just like this website. The styles, the site map, everything is generated 1:1
compared to the website.

The link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos-website[mobile-nixos-website]
repository holds the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/website.yml[
machinery] that updates the site, in addition to the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos-website/tree/master/website[news items].
This is where content specific for the website is written.

==== New ports

Three new devices were merged this month.

* Google Pixel XL (google-marlin) [link:https://github.com/danielfullmer[@danielfullmer]] (link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/51[#51])
* Google Pixel 2 (google-walleye) [link:https://github.com/samueldr[@samueldr]] (link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/50[#50])
* Xiaomi A1 (xiaomi-tissot) [link:https://github.com/lheckemann[@lheckemann]] (link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/47[#47])

The Pixel devices should be trivial to adapt to their respective non-XL and XL
variants.
