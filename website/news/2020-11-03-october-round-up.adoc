This update is the eleventh in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.


=== Notable changes

During the month link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-10+sort%3Acreated-asc[
14 pull requests were  merged].

Some interesting changes were made during the month, let's look at some of
them.


==== Re-done kernel builder ergonomics

The goal of this change is to link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/212[
make the kernel derivations as lean as possible], relying on the builder,
rather than relying on copy-pasting common patterns around.

This is a change that was needed since the project was started. Though, it
could not have happened much earlier than this late in the project. This is
because multiple different quirky kernels needed to exist to properly show what
needed to be abstracted.

With this, all common patterns for quirks have been identified and put behind
flags. Those flags are described in link:https://mobile.nixos.org/in-depth/kernel-builder.html[
Notes about the kernel builder].

End-users shouldn't see any difference, this will help people who make ports.

===== Compile kernels only once

While testing the previous change, it was observed by link:https://github.com/danielfullmer[
@danielfullmer] that kernel compilation happened twice for some devices.

This was not a regression. Though looking at things trying to find problems you
are bound to see the existing flaws!

This was worked around by link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/217[
doing everything in one `make` invocation]. The end-result is that some kernel
builds will finish twice as quickly!


==== Pinephone Modem support improvements

Simply put, link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/231[the modem has
been verified to work with LTE data].

With that said, there's more to it. End-users shouldn't have to care about a
deeply-rooted `/sys` fs path to turn the modem off or on. This is why the
`modem-control` service has been added. It mirrors the modem's state using
`bindsTo` and `wantedBy`.

With this service, the modem is better integrated with systemd, but more
importantly the user can stop and start it using `systemctl`, rather than to
dig for a particular less user-friendly path.

Calls and SMS will be tested at a later point in time. Though it is expected
that calls will require some work for the audio to work properly (a known
upstream issue).
