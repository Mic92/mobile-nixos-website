This update is the sixth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.

=== Notable changes

link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-04+sort%3Acreated-asc[11 PRs were merged]
during the month. Not an exciting month with fun and visible progress, but
let's point out interesting changes

==== Supported way to include from system configuration

In link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/123[PR #123] a supported way
to include a device configuration to the system configuration was added. The
link:https://mobile.nixos.org/getting-started.html[Getting Started] page
explains the details.

This is useful when combined with the next higlighted changes. The device
specific configuration doesn't have to be handled by the end-user, the Mobile
NixOS configuration handles it.

==== WCNSS WLAN _quirk_

link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/126[PR #126] adds support for
WCNSS WLAN in Mobile NixOS, while enabling it for the only device that supports
it.

This is the simplest Wi-Fi setup for Qualcomm-based hardware. Sadly, for other
devices it's much more involved.

Though, this does mean that we now have Wi-Fi support for one more device!

*Bonus change*: Buried in that same PR, we now use `boot.initrd.enable = false`
rather than using `isContainer`. This fixes a couple of weird and annoying
issues with the running system.

==== Device-specific polishing

 * link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/126[PR #126]
 * link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/128[PR #128]

These start implementing some _polishing_, in what I hope becomes the gold
standard for device ports.

First, we configure the LEDs so the Linux kernel controls it during
boot (link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/blob/6be1a3bf0ca7d4f956b7dab4bab932071c402026/devices/asus-z00t/kernel/0002-ze550kl-Green-LED-now-defaults-to-on.patch#L21-L30[z00t],
link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/blob/6be1a3bf0ca7d4f956b7dab4bab932071c402026/devices/oneplus-oneplus3/kernel/0001-oneplus3-Configure-LEDs-using-kernel-triggers.patch#L38-L41[oneplus3]).
This provides a tangible proof to the end-user that the kernel is
currently in control and running.

Then, for `asus-z00t`, some kernel cleanup patches have been added. The first
kind of change is to remove _idiotic_ behaviour from the OEM kernel, like
link:https://github.com/samueldr-wip/mobile-nixos-wip/blob/640f2d4c794c2066797a31157c324c437b200250/devices/asus-z00t/kernel/0001-firmware-class-Remove-rude-firmware-path-trampling.patch[
trampling over the kernel module load path]. The second is more subtle, but
welcomed when reading `dmesg`: reduce the useless logging present in some
modules. The amount of logging is useless.

Finally, for `oneplus-oneplus3`, there's a link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/commit/c7a121fbaeedfd8e493127355588b7a511ad393d[
_quirk_ to fix USB OTG support] during boot. I don't think any other device
will need it, from a quick glance, but it's still a good example of how to
implement a _quirk_.

=== Ports

No new port were made in April. There is still a 
link:https://mobile.nixos.org/devices/index.html[total of 11 devices] you can
build for.
