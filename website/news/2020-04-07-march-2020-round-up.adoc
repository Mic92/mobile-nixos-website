This update is the fifth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.

=== Notable changes

link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2020-03+sort%3Acreated-asc[17 PRs were merged]
during the month. (The link says 18, but one of them was, to me, late in
February, read the previous news item).

Let's look at some of these.

==== Pine64 Pinephone “Braveheart”

This was teased about on the link:https://twitter.com/samueldr/status/1237478576443854848[
author's twitter account]. link:https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/[The inexpensive
Pinephone] is the latest new device added to Mobile NixOS.

This brings a bit more than only a new device. This is the fourth system type
added to Mobile NixOS. The added system type (U-Boot) in theory will give us
the ability to support any U-Boot-based system in a common way. In practice the
still unmerged and WIP link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/94[#94]
shows how this is true by using U-Boot with another Pine64 device, the 
_Pinebook Pro_.

A nice thing that was verified again with this new device port is that the
stage-2 image (the rootfs, the system.img) is indeed universal. It is using the
same AArch64 build of the system image as Android-based devices, and
Depthcharge-based devices.

Our build for the Pinephone relies on the link:https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/linux[
downstream kernel from the Pine64 community], with only one added patch.
The same is done for the U-Boot build.

The added patches are user-experience-focused patches that are using the RGB
LED of the phone to show the boot status.

Other than that, the hardware support is not complete, but it is supported at
the same level as other devices, plus Wi-Fi working.

See link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/96[PR #96] for all the details.

==== Hydra builds

This is not entirely an in-repository change. There's link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/97[#97]
and link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/113[#133] that are relevant
to this. The link:https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/mobile-nixos/unstable[mobile-nixos:unstable jobset]
on Hydra is the other part of the puzzle.

What this gives us is automatic continuous builds of Mobile NixOS against the
`nixos-unstable` NixOS channel. From this, we can track changes that break the
Mobile NixOS builds, and track internal breakage to some parts of Mobile NixOS.

This is not even the best part. As can be seen in link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/113[#133],
we are now delivering up-to-date stage-2 rootfs, which allows end-users without
the required hardware to link:https://mobile.nixos.org/getting-started.html#_using_a_pre_built_system_img[
bootstrap themselves using a pre-built image]. The requirement to have a native
AArch64 machine to build the system image is no more. While not ideal, users
could make use of their phone to build a customized image, or simply, do a
`nixos-rebuild` on it.

It already paid its worth in gold, as by the time this was developed, two
regressions were spotted and quickly fixed. And furthermore, I hope that the
exercising of the cross-compilation framework will help the NixOS developers
working on making cross-compilation better in NixOS.

==== Other mentions

* Using GitHub Actions, link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/112[#112]
  checks new PRs for some simple breakage.

* Developers can now use `nconfig` to configure their kernel using the “porcelain”
  `bin/menuconfig`, as added in link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/109[#109].

=== Ports

One new device has been merged during March.
