project.

=== Notable changes

Among the changes, and the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2019-12[10 PRs merged],
these changes are highlighted.


==== Make the demo more useful on a touch device

These are changes to the "example" system. This is a finalized version of the
demo system that was running on the devices during NixCon 2019.

The main difference is that this is not a raw XFCE desktop, but a
pre-configured system that is more accessible on touch devices. The onboard
on-screen keyboard is configured to be of a useful height. Additionally, XFWM
has been replaced with Awesome WM configured to maximize all windows.

This is still not an appropriate mobile environment, only a collection of
configuration that makes it work well enough to test things up.

==== Enhance QEMU Device

The `x86_64` based QEMU VM has seen fixes to, first, make it actually work
right.

What's more interesting in this PR is the patched VGA BIOS that rotates the
expected resolutions (720p, 1080p) on their side in portrait mode. This is
especially helpful when working on purely software things like improving the
example system.

These changes are part of 
link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/59[pull request #59].


==== Different stage-1 fixes

The root filesystem is configured to expand to the size of its backing
partition during boot.

Critical failure states link:https://mobile.nixos.org/in-depth/stage-1.html#_about_sad_phone_screens[are graphically reported].
As documented, a full-screen color-coded "sad phone" gives a general idea of
the error encountered.
