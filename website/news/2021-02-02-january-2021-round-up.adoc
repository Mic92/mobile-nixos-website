This update is the fourteenth in a series of regular updates on the state of the
project.

Only changes that have been accepted and merged in Mobile NixOS are
chronicled here. There's always link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls[more work]
currently in-progress.


=== Notable changes

During the month link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2021-01+sort%3Acreated-asc[
18 pull requests were  merged].

Buckle-up, this month there's a lot to say.

==== Go go all USB gadget modes

A couple changes this month are related to USB gadget mode. This is the name of
the feature allowing a device (your cellphone) to be used as a USB device
on your computer.

===== Target disk mode

This is not a fresh feature, the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/110[
implementation pull request] was opened in March 2020.

Once a device is booted with this example system, the device's internal storage
is made available over USB, as if it was a USB mass storage device.

The feature is limited to select devices, as it can be easily misused. The
`pine64-pinephone` and `asus-dumo` devices are configured for this feature.
It is limited as the block device to export has to be configured on a
per-device basis. A further reason is the following:

[WARNING]
====
Target disk mode *should not* be used to export the full drive of Android-based
devices as it _becomes trivial to brick a device_. Some of their partitions
should not be touched.

This is because for most Android-based devices, part of their basic firmware
needed for booting is found on the main block device. Erasing or modifying the
wrong partition would be like erasing the BIOS from your computer.
====

===== Broader ADB support

Time was taken to understand why _ADB_ didn't work on newer Android-based
devices. It was initially suspected that the ADB daemon was incompatible with
GadgetFS and FunctionFS.

It was much more trivial. link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/usb/functionfs.html[
The _FunctionFS_ feature of the kernel] needed the daemon to be started at a
specific moment during the configuration, rather than at any time after.

With link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/290[the fixes in #290] any
device with GadgetFS can use ADB.

This means inspecting newer Android-based devices is easier, as it will most
likely work if the device boots with a vendor kernel.

Using ADB is not limited to Android-based devices. The `asus-dumo` device is
confirmed to be able to also use ADB. It is now the recommended basic method
for getting a shell into a Mobile NixOS device, as it is easier to use than
`rndis`.


==== LVGUI updates

A few updates were link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/285[
bundled together in #285]. A few improvements to the early boot toolkit.

===== DRM support

Our toolkit used for user interfaces during early boot can now use DRM for
rendering, in addition to fbdev.

The old framebuffer support is still present. In fact, compiling with DRM
support implicitly also builds with fbdev support, as it will fall back to
fbdev if DRM cannot be used. This allows one unique build to be used across
devices with and without DRM support.

Adding support for DRM gives us an additional method of rendering. Some vendor
kernels have broken fbdev implementations, like the SDM845 found in the
`razer-cheryl2` phone. With this change, early boot can be used on this device.

DRM is also the "future" of rendering on Linux. Well, it is the present of
rendering on Linux. This is why it is now the preferred method to render the
interface, when possible.

===== Libinput support

The evdev-based input driver has been replaced with a libinput driver. Libinput
is the current recommended method for handling input with Linux. Evdev being
one of the primitive constructs it uses.

Compared to the previous evdev driver used, there should be no differences
with basic behaviour. Mainly, this was a clean-up, allowing us to remove some
hacks that were used to identify device types with evdev. Libinput
intrinsically knows more about the device than evdev did.


==== Device-specific changes

===== Wi-Fi support for qcacld-2.0 devices

The requirements for devices with `qcacld-2.0` Wi-Fi hardware have been
identified.

Support has been added in the following pull requests for the following devices:

* link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/280[#280 samsung-a5y17lte]
* link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/289[#289 oneplus-oneplus3]

The following device also uses `qcacld-2.0` Wi-Fi. Support has not been added
yet.

===== Initial support for Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017)

Support for the link:https://github.com/NixOS/mobile-nixos/pull/278[
Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017)] has been added.

It is the first Exynos device in Mobile NixOS, with an Exynos 7880. The device
is otherwise unremarkable, it turns out that Mobile NixOS mostly just worked
with Samsung's initial boot flow. It required some minor adjustments, which
are likely to help with their other phones and tablets.

===== Pinephone U-Boot update

January saw the release of U-Boot 2021.01. Mobile NixOS was already one version
late, as 2020.10 was never packaged.

As with the previous update, upstream U-Boot is used, preferring to import
well-identified patches for the remaining features desired.

This change should change nothing for many users. Users with a 3GB variant of
the Pinephone will be relieved to know that they can now boot Mobile NixOS
without additional work.


==== Other notable changes
